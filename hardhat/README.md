# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a
Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# compile
yarn compile

# test
yarn test

# deploy on Sepolia
yarn deploy <ignition module file path>

# deploy and verify on Sepolia
yarn deploy:verify <ignition module file path>
```
